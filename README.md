# Game Development Framework

This repository provides a solid foundation for building efficient and customizable games using a modular, event-driven architecture. The framework leverages the flexibility of Scriptable Objects and prioritizes ease of use to streamline development workflows.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Enables loose coupling between components and facilitates clear communication flow.
- **Modular Design:** Promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance by separating functionalities into independent modules.
- **Scriptable Object Integration:** Provides a powerful and flexible way to manage game data and logic.

### Data Management

- Unified solution for data handling.
- PersistantData wrapper for PlayerPrefs enables storage of complex structures and JSON support.

### Level Management

- Automates game level management.
- Ensures seamless looping upon completion.

### Scene Management

- Offers asynchronous scene loading for smooth transitions.
- Provides customizable transition styles (fade, shape, etc.).

### Object Pool Manager (Tag-Based)

- Optimizes performance by reusing objects and reducing memory usage.

## Additional Tools

- Asset Preprocessors (e.g., Sprite Preprocessor): Streamline the asset pipeline by automating tasks like image optimization or atlas generation.
- Custom Property Drawers: Enhance the development experience with custom editors for specific data types in the inspector.

## Getting Started

This framework is currently under development.

**Coming Soon:**

- Detailed documentation outlining usage instructions and code examples.
- Contribution guidelines for those interested in expanding the framework's functionalities.
